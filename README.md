#Stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project

Performed stock analysis on the dataset. Developed macro code to loop through all the data one time in order
to identify which stock is performing well and which is not. We wanted to see the total volume of each stock 
from the beginning to the end of the years for 2017 and 2018. Additonally, we wanted to see the percentage return for
each of the 12 stocks over a year. By performing this analysis Steve will be able to recommend which (if any) of those
stocks his parents should invest in. To do this analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide our client with an Excel workbook including an easy-to-run VBA macro able to analyze an entire dataset of stocks. This tool will help him in its financial expertise.
