# Stock-analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide our client with an Excel workbook including an easy-to-run VBA macro able to analyze an entire dataset of stocks. This tool will help him in its financial expertise.
The analysis was ran using two VBA scripts: the original script produced through the Module #2 and a refactored version of it. We would then have the opportunity to compare the performances of both scripts, and highlights the pros and cons of refactoring a code.

## Results
